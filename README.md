# Python-Challenge

Please find attached the code and outputs for this assignment.

Note - after discussions with Chase, there is a slight configuration problem with my laptop - it is a works machine with extensive security on due to it being part of a school system so when the code is first run, I have to enter in for the Financial Analysis cd Desktop/PyBank/Resources and for the Election Data I entered in cd Desktop/PyElectionData/Resources which is where the files were originally saved.  I am not allowed to change the settings on the machine so this was the "fix" that Chase and I came up with, and it gives the correct results, and these are repeatable.

In terms of debugging, apart from the previously mentioned, the code ran, and gave the same output on every occassion once I'd finished the code and made any changes needed.  I added comments to show what I was intending to do at each stage.

I have copied and pasted the files into the folder structured as per the original instructions, as well as giving screenshots of the final data outputs from the terminal
